Under the provisions of the Act, any citizen of India may request information from a &#8220;public authority&#8221; (a body of Government or &#8220;instrumentality of State&#8221;) which is required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days. The Act also requires every public authority to computerise their records for wide dissemination and to proactively certain categories of information so that the citizens need minimum recourse to request information formally.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">This law was passed by Parliament on 15 June 2005 and came fully into force on 12 October 2005. The first application was given to a Pune police station. Information disclosure in India was restricted by the Official Secrets Act 1923 and various other special laws, which the new RTI Act relaxes. It codifies a fundamental right of citizens.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Right to Information Act 2005 mandates timely response to citizen requests for government information. It is an initiative taken by the Department of Personnel and Training, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions to provide an RTI Portal Gateway to the citizens for quick search of information on the details of first Appellateities, PIOs etc. amongst others, besides access to RTI related information/disclosures published on the web by various Publicities under the Government of India as well as the State Governments.</p>
<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">The Act covers the whole of India except Jammu and Kashmir. It covers all constitutional authorities, including the executive, legislature and judiciary; any institution or body established or constituted by an act of Parliament or a state legislature. It is also defined in the Act that bodies or authorities established or constituted by order or notification of appropriate government including bodies &#8220;owned, controlled or substantially financed&#8221; by government, or non-Government organizations &#8220;substantially financed, directly or indirectly by funds&#8221;</p>
